# NEXT js / React slider

### this is all preparation for my ideas on my exam project
So created these component and tryouts to learn and be able to use in my exam project and future projects

Might be a bit messy for some but I like this way of working, and I can adapt to what ever work methods that people like the most. 
Having a mind full of ideas that is having its own bursts is sometimes an advantage

using the react-responsive-carousel to try out slider for images and content
one slider is using only images and the other from a "fake-json-db" 
https://my-json-server.typicode.com/

uploading the db as a repo on github and fetching the info from the api
